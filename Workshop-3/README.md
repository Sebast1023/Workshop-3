##  Workshop Description
This workshop focuses on designing a **robust and maintainable system architecture** and developing a **project management plan** aligned with engineering and quality standards (ISO 9000, CMMI, Six Sigma, and ISO/IEC 27001).  
The deliverables include the refined architecture, risk and quality management analysis, project plan, and incremental improvement summary.

All sections are compiled into the document:  
 **`Workshop3_Report.pdf`**

## Section References

### **1. Review and Refine – System Architecture**
Describes the **refined layered architecture** for the GEFCom2012 Wind Forecasting System.  
Includes the updated **Mermaid diagram (diagram1.png)** showing all system layers, components, and fault-tolerant flows.  
Applies design principles such as modularity, observability, and fault isolation.

### **2. Risk and Quality Management**
Identifies key risks — **data loss**, **model drift**, and **system downtime** — and provides mitigation strategies following ISO/IEC 25010, ISO/IEC 27001, and NIST SP 800-30.  
Explains how automated retraining, backups, and encryption maintain system reliability and security.

### **3. Project Management Plan**
Defines **roles, milestones, and methodologies** used by the team:  
- Roles (Manager, Analyst, Developer, DevOps)  
- Milestones (M1–M4: from ingestion to monitoring)  
- Tools: GitHub Projects, Google Sheets (Gantt), and Agile Scrum.  
Includes a **workflow diagram** showing how technical stages align with project milestones.

### **4. Incremental Improvements**
Summarizes **lessons learned** from Workshops 1 and 2 and how they led to improvements in modularity, retraining automation, and management structure.  
Demonstrates the evolution from analytical design → modular architecture → robust feedback-driven system.

### **5. Documentation and Reflection**
Confirms the consolidation of all deliverables in this folder and the GitHub repository.  
Reflects on challenges such as balancing diagram clarity, fault-tolerance mechanisms, and the integration of standards.  
Highlights how the final design achieves long-term maintainability and reliability.
